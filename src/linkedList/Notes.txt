LinkedList (single LL)
----------
1. LL is similar to an Array.
2. LL elements access in linear way.
3. LL elements are not stored in contigious memory allocation (non-linear way).
4. Each element of LL is called a Node.
5. Each node of LL contains:
    |- Data - It holds the value of the node.
    |- Next - It holds the address/reference of the next node.
6. Last node of the LL contains NULL in the next part of the node.
7. Last node aka TAIL node.
8. Starting node of the LL is called HEAD node.
9. if the value of HEAD is equal to NULL then we can say that, LL is empty.

Examples:
    Program1
        Operations
            |- insertFirst
            |- insertLast
            |- deleteFirst
            |- deleteLast
            |- SearchElement
            |- HW: Count No of element of the LL
            |- HW: Count No of unique element of the LL (ignore duplicates)
            |- HW: Check the LL elements are in palindromic or not
            |- HW: Copy LL elements into another LL in InsertLast manner.
            |- HW: find the middle element of the LL.
            |- HW: insert an element at the middle of the LL.


Circular LinkedList (single LL)
-------------------
-> Head=Tail == null, CLL is empty
    Example:
        Program2.java
                Operations
                        |- insertFirst
                        |- insertLast
                        |- deleteFirst
                        |- deleteLast
                        |- HW: SearchElement
                        |- Count No of element of the LL
                        |- HW: Count No of unique element of the LL (ignore duplicates)
                        |- HW: Check the LL elements are in palindromic or not
                        |- HW: Copy LL elements into another LL in InsertLast manner.
                        |- HW: find the middle element of the LL.
                        |- HW: insert an element at the middle of the LL.



 LinkedList class
 ----------------------
 1. LinkedList class is an implementation class of list interface
 2. LinkedList class uses doubly LinkedList concept for data management
 3. LinkedList class is a member of java.util package
 4. LinkedList class is a non synchronized class(not a thread-safe class)
 5. it allows duplicate values
 6. methods:-
              public void addFirst(E);
              public void addLast(E);
              public int size();
              public E get(int);
              public void clear();

Program5 :-

               public boolean remove(java.lang.Object);
               public E removefirst();
               public E removeLast();

Progarm6 :-

public E set(int, E);


Program7 :-
              public boolean contains(java.lang.Object);

              public boolean add(E);
              public boolean remove(java.lang.Object);
              public boolean addAll(java.util.Collection<? extends E>);
              public boolean addAll(int, java.util.Collection<? extends E>);

              public E remove(int);
              public java.util.ListIterator<E> listIterator(int);
              public java.util.Iterator<E> descendingIterator();
              public java.lang.Object clone()
