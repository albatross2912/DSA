Graph DS :-


9. Graph traversing technique
   ---------------------------
       |- Depth first search [Stack
       |- Breadth first search [Queue]

10. Spanning Tree
    -------------
    |-  A ST is a sub-graph of undirected connected graph.
    |- It includes all the vertices with minimum number of Edges.
    |- is any vertex is missed, then oit not a ST.
    |- minimum ST (MST) ***
       |- It used to find the ST from the weight graph by check the minimum weight of the edge.
       |- To ensure, that no cycle in the minimum spanning tree.
       |- There are two Algorithm for find the MST.
            |- Prim's Algorithm
                |- Program5

            |- Kruskal Algorithm
                |- Program6
